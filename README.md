# AVR-Sign-Language-Glove

## Project Overview

The **AVR-Sign-Language-Glove** project aims to develop a wearable device that translates sign language into voice and text using AVR microcontrollers. This device is designed to help individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing communicate more effectively by converting hand signs into spoken words and text.

## Features

- **Real-Time Translation:** Converts hand signs into voice and text in real-time.
- **Wearable Glove Design:** Utilizes sensors embedded in a glove for capturing hand gestures.
- **AVR Microcontroller:** Employs AVR microcontrollers for processing and translation.
- **Voice Output:** Provides spoken translations through a connected speaker or audio module.
- **Text Display:** Shows translated text on an LCD or other display.

## Components

- **AVR Microcontroller:** Handles processing and translation of sign language gestures.
- **Flex Sensors:** Detect finger movements and hand gestures.
- **Speaker/Audio Module:** Outputs voice translations.
- **LCD/Display Module:** Shows translated text.
- **Battery:** Provides power to the glove and its components.

## Hardware Setup

1. **Connect Sensors to AVR Microcontroller:**
   - **Flex Sensors:** Attach to the fingers to detect bending.
2. **Integrate Voice and Text Output Modules:**
   - **Speaker/Audio Module:** Connect for voice output.
   - **LCD/Display Module:** Connect for text display.
3. **Power Supply:**
   - Ensure proper connection of the battery to power all components.

## Software Setup

1. **Microcontroller Programming:**
   - Program the AVR microcontroller with the provided firmware to handle sensor inputs and perform gesture recognition.
2. **Gesture Recognition Algorithm:**
   - Implement algorithms to translate gestures into corresponding words or phrases.
3. **Voice and Text Output Integration:**
   - Configure the voice and text output modules to display or speak the translated content.

## Usage

1. **Wear the Glove:**
   - Put on the glove and ensure all sensors are properly aligned.
2. **Perform Hand Gestures:**
   - Use predefined hand signs for translation.
3. **View/Listen to Translation:**
   - Check the LCD or listen to the speaker for the translated text or voice output.
